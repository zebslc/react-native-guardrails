# Application Guardrails

This folder contains rules and best practices for application-level concerns (performance, documentation, error handling, dependency management, etc.).

---

## üìÅ Folder Structure Guidance

When starting a new project, set up your folders as follows:

```
/guardrails
  /application         ‚Üê App-level guardrails
  /components          ‚Üê Component guardrails
  /data                ‚Üê Data, API, state, and storage guardrails
  /deployment          ‚Üê Build, release, analytics, telemetry guardrails
  /expo                ‚Üê Expo Go & managed workflow guardrails
  /media               ‚Üê Media (audio, camera, etc.) guardrails
  /native              ‚Üê Native code & advanced feature guardrails
  /navigation          ‚Üê Navigation guardrails
  /permissions         ‚Üê Permissions guardrails
  /platform-support    ‚Üê Device/platform compatibility guardrails
  /scripts             ‚Üê Project scripts and script guardrails
  /security            ‚Üê Security and permissions guardrails
  /styling             ‚Üê Styling, fonts, tokens, accessibility, i18n guardrails
  /testing             ‚Üê Testing and testability guardrails
  /tooling             ‚Üê Tooling, Metro config, AI context guardrails
```

- Use the `expo/` folder for rules and examples that work with Expo Go or the Expo managed workflow.
- Use the `native/` folder for rules, examples, and setup instructions for custom native code or advanced features (e.g., real-time audio, custom device APIs).
- Place platform-specific implementations (Android, iOS, Web) in their respective folders as needed.

---

## üö¶ Choosing Your Workflow

- **If your app only uses Expo APIs and does not require custom native code:**  
  Follow the guardrails in the `expo/` folder.
- **If your app needs advanced features or custom native modules:**  
  Follow the guardrails in the `native/` folder and set up your project using the provided instructions.

## üìù Sample Prompt for New Projects

> Specify at project start:  
> ‚ÄúWill this application use advanced features (e.g., real-time audio, custom device APIs) that require native code, or can it run entirely with Expo Go?‚Äù

Example prompt for AI/codegen tools:
```
I am starting a new React Native project.  
- If the app will use only Expo APIs and no custom native code, set up the folder structure and guardrails for Expo Go.  
- If the app will require advanced features or custom native modules, set up the folder structure and guardrails for native code, and include platform-specific folders for Android, iOS, and Web.
