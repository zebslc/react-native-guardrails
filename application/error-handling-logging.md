# Error Handling & Logging

## Error Boundaries
- Use React error boundaries to catch and handle UI errors gracefully.

## Centralized Logging & Reporting
- Integrate with centralized error reporting tools (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag).
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging.

## User Experience
- Show user-friendly error messages and fallback UIs.
- Avoid exposing technical details to end users.
