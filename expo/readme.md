# Expo Guardrails

This folder contains rules, best practices, and configuration files specifically for projects using the **Expo managed workflow** or **Expo custom dev client**.

## What belongs here?

- Guardrails and examples that work with Expo Go or Expo’s managed APIs.
- Usage of Expo-specific libraries (e.g., `expo-av`, `expo-font`, `expo-camera`).
- Patterns and restrictions that apply to the managed workflow (e.g., no custom native code in Expo Go).
- Scripts and configuration for Expo projects.

## When to use these guardrails

- If you are using Expo Go or building with Expo’s managed workflow.
- If you are using a custom dev client, these rules still apply, but you can also use native code (see the `native` folder for those cases).

> For advanced features (like real-time audio synthesis, custom device APIs, or native libraries), see the `native` folder.
